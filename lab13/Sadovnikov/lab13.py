class SplayTree():
    """Splay Tree itself.

    Splay tree is self-adjusting binary search tree. Pros of using this type of trees are that tree doesn't need to keep
    any extra information about itself, what makes it efficient in terms of memory usage, also splay tree works much
    faster than other types of binary trees when working with real input data.
    In situations, when we work with already built binary search tree and need to respond to queries such as "whether
    this key is present in the tree or not", and the user is mostly interested in one key and queries others only from
    time to time, we might face a problem of processing m number of queries in O(m log(n)) time. But splay tree will
    process such number of queries in O(m) due to its self-adjusting structure.
    Obvious disadvantage of splay tree is that its height can be linear, Although all its methods still work in
    amortized O(log(n)) time.

    Algorithm:
    Accessing any of the nodes executes splay operation that moves accessed node to the root ot the tree. Splaying
    consists of two steps: zig ,zig-zig and zig-zag. Let's assume that current node is x, parent is parent of x and
    grandparent is parent of parent. Zig step is done when parent of x is the root. The tree is rotated from x to p.
    Zig-zig is done when parent is not the root and x and parent are either both right children or are both left
    children. The tree is rotated from parent to grandparent, then rotated from x to parent. Zig-zag is done when parent
    is not the root and x is a right child and parent is a left child. The tree is rotated from x to parent, and then
    rotated from x to grandparent.
